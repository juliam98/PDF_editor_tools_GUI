# PDF_editor_tools_GUI

A simple GUI for editing PDF files. 

It is currently being developed for rotating individual pages in PDF files, and for merging two documents. 

The current version was uploaded as a representation of the visual aspect of the GUI, but tit is not yet functional. The code was written on a mac, so future versions will be adjusted for any potential issues for Windows users. 

Stay tuned for updates.
